// In Rust, a mod.rs file is used to define and organize modules within a directory.
// Rustâ€™s module system is hierarchical, and mod.rs acts as the entry point for modules within a directory.
// It defines which other files are part of the module and can be used to re-export functions, structs, or other modules.

// This file also contains logic for the Factory pattern.
// We have a single entry point for construction, and the factory will spit out the correct struct we need for our parameters.
