Nice! That‚Äôs a great modern stack‚Äî**Rust with Axum** is super performant and secure, and **React + TypeScript** is perfect for a rich, interactive frontend.

Given your setup, here‚Äôs a tailored authentication scheme recommendation:

---

## ‚úÖ **Best Auth Strategy for Axum + React TS**

### üîê Use **JWT-Based Auth with Access + Refresh Tokens**, stored in **HttpOnly Cookies**

This gives you the best combo of **security**, **scalability**, and **user experience**‚Äîespecially with an SPA frontend.

---

### üîß **High-Level Setup**

#### üßæ 1. **Access Token (short-lived, e.g., 15 minutes)**
- JWT signed with your secret key
- Stored in an **HttpOnly cookie** (secure, cannot be accessed via JavaScript)
- Sent with every request (automatically via browser if using `SameSite` cookies)

#### üîÅ 2. **Refresh Token (longer-lived, e.g., 7 days)**
- Also stored in **HttpOnly cookie**
- Used to get a new access token when it expires
- Can be revoked via server-side storage (e.g., Redis or database)

#### üõ† 3. **Backend (Axum) Responsibilities**
- Verify JWT access tokens on protected routes
- Provide `/login`, `/logout`, and `/refresh` endpoints
- Store refresh token identifiers in DB (with user_id, expiry) to allow revocation
- Use something like `jsonwebtoken` crate for JWT

#### ‚öõÔ∏è 4. **Frontend (React TS) Responsibilities**
- Call login API ‚Üí server sets cookies
- Access protected routes ‚Üí no need to manually attach tokens (browser handles cookies)
- On 401/403 ‚Üí call `/refresh` endpoint to renew access token
- If refresh fails ‚Üí redirect to login

---

### üîí Security Best Practices

- Use **HttpOnly**, **Secure**, and **SameSite=Strict or Lax** on cookies
- Always serve over HTTPS
- Encrypt tokens if storing sensitive data (or don‚Äôt store sensitive info in the token at all‚Äîjust `sub`, `exp`, etc.)
- Rotate JWT secrets periodically (and manage revocation with refresh token storage)

---

### Bonus Features to Consider
- Add **OAuth 2.0 (e.g., Google, GitHub)** login later using `openidconnect` crate
- Add **rate limiting + brute-force protection** for login endpoint
- Optional: Use `argon2` or `bcrypt` for password hashing in Axum

### Further breakdown:

1. Access Token (Short-lived, ~15 minutes):

    This is the JWT token stored in an HttpOnly cookie [1]

    Used for authenticating regular API requests

    When it expires, you need to get a new one using the refresh token [2]

    The same access token is reused for multiple requests until it expires

2. Refresh Token (Longer-lived, ~7 days):

    Also stored in an HttpOnly cookie [3]

    Only used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires

    Not used for regular API requests



You don't need to generate a new JWT token for every request. Instead, the flow works like this:

    User logs in ‚Üí receives both access token and refresh token in HttpOnly cookies

    User makes API requests ‚Üí uses the same access token until it expires

    When access token expires (401/403 response):

        Frontend calls the refresh endpoint

        Server validates refresh token

        If valid, issues new access token

        The new access token is then used for subsequent requests



### CORS, CSRF, JWT breakdown:


CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) : [1]

        A browser security mechanism that controls which domains can access your API

        Handles the "Can domain A make requests to domain B?" question

        Implemented through HTTP headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin

        Manages preflight requests (OPTIONS) for complex HTTP requests

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) :

        Protects against malicious sites making unauthorized requests using your cookies

        Prevents attacks where another site tricks your browser into making requests to your API

        Usually implemented using a token that must be included in requests

        Important when using cookie-based authentication (including JWT in cookies)

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) :

        Handles authentication ("Who is the user?")

        Contains encoded user information and claims

        Can be stored in HttpOnly cookies (more secure) or localStorage

        Used to maintain user sessions and protect routes
