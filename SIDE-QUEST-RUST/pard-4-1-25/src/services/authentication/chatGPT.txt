Nice! That’s a great modern stack—**Rust with Axum** is super performant and secure, and **React + TypeScript** is perfect for a rich, interactive frontend. Given your setup, here’s a tailored authentication scheme recommendation:

---

## ✅ **Best Auth Strategy for Axum + React TS**

### 🔐 Use **JWT-Based Auth with Access + Refresh Tokens**, stored in **HttpOnly Cookies**

This gives you the best combo of **security**, **scalability**, and **user experience**—especially with an SPA frontend.

---

### 🔧 **High-Level Setup**

#### 🧾 1. **Access Token (short-lived, e.g., 15 minutes)**
- JWT signed with your secret key
- Stored in an **HttpOnly cookie** (secure, cannot be accessed via JavaScript)
- Sent with every request (automatically via browser if using `SameSite` cookies)

#### 🔁 2. **Refresh Token (longer-lived, e.g., 7 days)**
- Also stored in **HttpOnly cookie**
- Used to get a new access token when it expires
- Can be revoked via server-side storage (e.g., Redis or database)

#### 🛠 3. **Backend (Axum) Responsibilities**
- Verify JWT access tokens on protected routes
- Provide `/login`, `/logout`, and `/refresh` endpoints
- Store refresh token identifiers in DB (with user_id, expiry) to allow revocation
- Use something like `jsonwebtoken` crate for JWT

#### ⚛️ 4. **Frontend (React TS) Responsibilities**
- Call login API → server sets cookies
- Access protected routes → no need to manually attach tokens (browser handles cookies)
- On 401/403 → call `/refresh` endpoint to renew access token
- If refresh fails → redirect to login

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Use **HttpOnly**, **Secure**, and **SameSite=Strict or Lax** on cookies
- Always serve over HTTPS
- Encrypt tokens if storing sensitive data (or don’t store sensitive info in the token at all—just `sub`, `exp`, etc.)
- Rotate JWT secrets periodically (and manage revocation with refresh token storage)

---

### Bonus Features to Consider
- Add **OAuth 2.0 (e.g., Google, GitHub)** login later using `openidconnect` crate
- Add **rate limiting + brute-force protection** for login endpoint
- Optional: Use `argon2` or `bcrypt` for password hashing in Axum

---

If you’d like, I can give you a small boilerplate layout for:
- JWT generation/verification in Axum
- Secure cookie handling
- A React login flow using fetch
