    Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy

    In this section, we’ll talk about modules and other parts of the module system, namely
    paths which allow you to name items;
    the use keyword that brings a path into scope;
    and the pub keyword to make items public.

    We’ll also discuss the as keyword, external packages, and the glob operator.
